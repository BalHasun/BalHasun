# 👋 Hi there, I'm Bal Elsada Hasun.

I'm a passionate and dedicated **Front-End Developer** with a strong foundation in **computer programming** and hands-on experience building modern web applications. I love turning creative ideas into user-friendly, responsive, and accessible websites.  

Born in **Damascus in 1996**, I graduated from **Ondokuz Mayıs University** (Computer Programming, 2022). My journey has included both academic success and real-world development experience—from building portfolio sites to working with large-scale data grids in enterprise apps.
